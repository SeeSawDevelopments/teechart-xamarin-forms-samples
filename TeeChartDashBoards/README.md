TeeChartDashBoards
==================

This sample is combining [TeeChart for Xamarin.Forms Component library](https://www.steema.com/product/forms) with [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms). 
It shows how easily it is to create a DashBoard app to display some Charts with a specific Series type and Data for each one.
